        <tr class="row-item"><td><span class="defTitle">What is the "halting problem" with regards to an uncomputable problem?</span> This is a clear and unambiguous problem known as the halting problem.
            Does it have a Turing machine solution? Can we find one single Turing
            machine that will solve every instance of this problem - that is, one that
            will give us the answer "Yes, halts" or "No, never halts" for every (Turing
            machine, initial tape) pair?
            This is an uncomputable problem; we will show that no Turing machine
            exists to solve this problem. Remember that we said it was not sufficient
            to look for such a machine and fail; we actually have to prove that no
            such machine can exist. The way to do this is to assume that such a Turing
            machine does exist and then show that this assumption leads to an impos-
            sible situation, so such a machine could not exist after all. This approach is
            called a proof by contradiction.</td></tr>

        <tr class="row-item"><td><span class="defTitle">Scientific method:</span> The scientific method entails observing the behavior of a system and formulating a hypothesis that tries to understand and explain that behavior.
            We then design and carry out experiments on the system to either prove
            or disprove the validity of our hypothesis. This is the fundamental way of
            gaining new scientific knowledge and understanding.</td></tr>

            set of mathematical equations and/or algorithmic procedures that capture
            the fundamental properties and behaviors of a system. This computational

            falling body model in the last section, but as discrete. That is, we model the
            behavior of a system only at an explicit and finite set of times. The moments
            we model are those times when an event takes place, an event being any activity that changes the state of our system. </td></tr>

        <tr>
            <td>
                <ol>
                    <li>Existence - The system might not yet exist, so it is not possible to
                        experiment directly on the actual system. In fact, we might be using a
                        model to help us with the construction of the system.</li>
                    <li>Physical realization - The system is not constructed from entities that
                        can be represented by physical objects. For example, it may be a social
                        system (such as welfare policies or labor practices) that can only be
                        simulated on a computer.</li>
                    <li>Safety - It might be too dangerous to experiment on the actual system
                        or a physical replica. For example, you would not want to try out a
                        new monetary policy that could economically devastate a population
                        or build a nuclear reactor using a new and unproven technology.</li>
                    <li>Speed of construction - It might take too much time to construct a physical
                        model. Sometimes it is faster to design and build a computer simulation.</li>
                    <li>Time scale - Some physical systems change too slowly or too quickly.
                        For example, an elementary particle in a high-speed accelerator may
                        decompose in 10215 seconds. At the other end of the time scale, some
                        ecosystems take thousands of years to react to a modification.
                        A simulation can easily model fractions of a second or billions of
                        years because time is simply a parameter in an equation.</li>
                    <li>Ethical behavior - Some physical models have serious moral and ethical consequences, perhaps the best known being the use of animals in
                        medical research. In this case, a computational model could eliminate
                        a great deal of suffering.</li>
                    <li>Ease of modification - If we are not happy with the design of a physical
                        model, we need to construct a brand-new one. In a simulation, we only
                        need to change some numerical parameters and rerun the existing model.</li>
