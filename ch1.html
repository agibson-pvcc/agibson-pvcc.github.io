                                of the computer be encoded as binary values and stored internally in the
                                memory unit along with the data. To solve a new problem, instead of rewiring
                                the machine, you would rewrite the sequence of instructions-that is, create
                                a new program. Von Neumann invented programming as it is known today.
                                The model of computing proposed by Von Neumann included many other
                                important features found on all modern computing systems, and to honor
                                him this model of computation has come to be known as the Von Neumann

                                needed to learn how to write commands in a high-level language. The occu    pation called programmer was born.</li></ul>

                                major change in the size and complexity of computers. In the late 1950s,
                                the bulky vacuum tube was replaced by a single transistor only a few milli-
                                meters in size, and memory was now constructed using tiny magnetic cores

                                integrated circuit. Rather than using discrete electronic components, integrated
                                circuits with transistors, resistors, and capacitors were photographically etched
                                onto a piece of silicon, which further reduced the size and cost of computers.</li></ul>
