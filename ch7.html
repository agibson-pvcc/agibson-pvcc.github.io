    </table>

    <table>
        <tr><td class="miniTitle">Briefly describe or define:</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Computer network - A computer network is a set of independent computer systems 
            interconnected by telecommunication links for the purpose of sharing information
            and resources.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Analog device (Define and give an example) - A physical
            quantity used to represent information, usually voltage level, is continuous
            and can take on any value. The voice-oriented dial-up telephone network was originally an analog
            medium.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Digital device (Define and give an example) - A computer produces digital 
            information - Specifically, a sequence of 0s and 1s. Digital devices including mobile phones, 
            cameras, speakers, video game
            consoles, and your automobile's sound system. </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Modem - A modem which modulates, or alters, a standard analog signal 
            called a carrier wave so that it encodes binary information. The modem modifies the physical
            characteristics of the carrier wave, such as amplitude or frequency, so that it
            is in one of two distinct states, one state representing 0 and the other state
            representing 1.</td></tr>    
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Bandwidth - A measure of the width of a frequency range.</td></tr>       
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Ethernet - In the commercial and office environment, the most widely used 
            broadband technology is Ethernet. Ethernet was developed in the mid-1970s by computer scientists at the 
            Xerox PARC research center in Palo Alto, California. It was originally designed to operate at
            10 Mbps using coaxial cable.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>WLAN - In a wireless local area network (WLAN), a short-distance form
            of wireless networking, a user transmits from his or her computer, 
            tablet, or smartphone to a local wireless base station, often referred to as a 3
            wireless router, access point, or hot spot, that is no more than a few 
            hundred feet away. This base station is then connected to a traditional wired
            network, such as a DSL or cable modem, to provide full Internet access.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>IEEE 802.11 wireless network standard - One of the most widely used standards for wireless local access is Wi-Fi,
            also referred to by its official name, the IEEE 802.11 wireless network
            standard. Wi-Fi is used to connect a computer to the Internet when it is
            within range (typically 150-300 feet or 45-90 meters) of a wireless base
            station, often advertised as a Wi-Fi hot spot.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>MAN - A relatively new development in wireless networking is the medium-distance
            metropolitan area network (MAN). This is a wireless network whose
            scope is larger than the few hundred feet of a WLAN, typically a few blocks up to an entire city. Its purpose 
            is to provide full Internet connectivity to all
            computers within a neighborhood or metropolitan area.</td></tr>    
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Internet of Things - From all that we have said, you might get the idea that 
            the Internet is solely a
            way for computer users, that is, people, to share computing resources or data
            in the form of text, images, or video. Although that was originally the case,
            it is no longer true. It is now possible to place uniquely identifiable network
            “tags” on objects as diverse as refrigerators, thermostats, automobiles, eye-
            glasses, TVs, pets, and machine tools. Today, any living object or mechanical
            entity with which we wish to communicate or to control is a candidate to be
            tagged.</td></tr>   
        <tr class="row-item"><td>LAN - A local area network (LAN) connects hardware devices such as comput-
            ers, printers, and storage devices that are all in relatively close proximity
            (150-300 ft/45-90 m).</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Repeater - A repeater is a device that simply amplifies and forwards a signal. In
            Figure 7.6(b), if the device connecting the two LANs is a repeater, then every
            message on LAN1 is forwarded to LAN2, and vice versa. Thus, when two
            Ethernet LANs are connected by a repeater, they function exactly as if they
            were a single network.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Bridge - A bridge is a “smarter” device that has knowledge about the nodes
            located on each separate network. It examines every message to see if it
            should be forwarded from one network to another. For example, if node A is
            sending a message to node B, both of which are on LAN1, then the bridge
            does nothing with the message. However, if node A on LAN1 is sending a
            message to node C on LAN2, then the bridge copies the message from LAN1
            onto LAN2 so node C is able to see it and read it.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>WAN - A wide area network or WAN connects devices
            that are not in close proximity but are across town, across the country, or
            across the ocean.</td></tr>    
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Packet and packet switching - A packet is a unit of data that travels over a network. 
            It contains both the data being transmitted and control information that helps it reach its destination. 
            Think of a packet as a small package that holds information and instructions for delivery. Packet switching is a 
            technique used in computer networks to transmit data as packets. Instead of reserving a dedicated communication channel 
            for the entire duration of a transmission, packet switching breaks the data into packets and sends them independently. 
            This method enables multiple users to share the network resources effectively.</td></tr>   
        <tr class="row-item"><td>ISP - A user's individual computer or a company's private network is connected to
            the rest of the world through an Internet service provider (ISP). An ISP is
            a business whose purpose is to provide access from a private network (such
            as a corporate or university network) to the Internet or from an individual's
            home computer to the Internet.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Firewall - Computer firewalls - hardware and software placed
            at the entry points to a company's private network to protect it from unauthorized
            access. These firewalls implement the security guidelines set up by the company,
            guidelines such as address filtering, specifying which Internet addresses to allow
            in and which to keep out, and service filtering, listing exactly which applications on
            your system should or should not be accessed over the network.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Protocol - In networking, a protocol is a mutually agreed-upon set of rules,
            conventions, and agreements for the efficient and orderly exchange of 
            information. Even though the Internet has more than 1 billion host machines made
            by dozens of different manufacturers and located in hundreds of countries,
            they can all exchange messages correctly and efficiently for one simple 
            reason: They have all agreed to use the same protocols to govern that exchange.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Cloud computing - The concept of a single large collection
            of accessible resources whose location is not known to the user is often
            referred to as cloud computing.</td></tr>    
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Net neutrality - The term net neutrality means that a public information network such as
            an Internet service provider (ISP) should treat all users, all platforms, and all
            content equally- essentially it should be operated like the water, electric, and
            gas companies, as publicly regulated utilities.</td></tr>    
    </table>

    <table>
        <tr><td class="miniTitle">Briefly describe the five layers of TCP/IP (The Internet protocol hierarchy) :</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Layer 1: Physical layer - The Physical layer protocols govern the exchange of binary digits (bits)
            across a physical communication channel, such as a fiber-optic cable, copper
            wire, or wireless radio channel. </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Layer 2: Data link layer - The Data Link layer protocols are responsible for 
            creating an error-free “message pipe,” in which messages go in one end and always
            come out the other end correctly and in the proper sequence. </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Layer 3: Network layer -  It is the job of the end-to-end Network layer 
            protocols to deliver a message from the site where it was created to its ultimate
            destination. To accomplish this delivery task, every node must agree to
            use the same addressing scheme so that everyone is able to identify that
            ultimate destination. Thus, the two critical responsibilities of the Network
            layer are as follows:
            - Creating a universal addressing scheme for all network nodes.
            - Delivering messages between any two nodes in the network. </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Layer 4: - Transport layer - Assigning port numbers to programs and remembering which program goes
            with which port is a part of the Transport layer protocols. Although each
            host computer has one IP address, it may at any instant in time have many
            active ports. </td></tr>    
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Layer 5: Application layer - The Application layer protocols are the rules for implementing the 
            end-user services provided by a network, and they are built on top of the first four
            protocol layers. </td></tr>   
    </table>

    <table>
        <tr><td class="miniTitle">List and briefly describe at least 3 network services and benefits:</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Email (electronic mail) - Email is convenient. You can send a message whenever you want, and it
            waits for the recipient to log on and read at his or her convenience. Email
            is fast. A message from the United States typically arrives anywhere in the
            world in a few seconds, even though it may have to pass through 15 or
            20 nodes along the way.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Social Networking - The use of web-based social networks has grown to the point where they
            are now some of the most well-known and widely used applications on the
            Internet, and there is hardly a person who is not thoroughly familiar with
            them and, more likely, a registered member of one or more. </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>Resource Sharing - Another important network service is resource 
            sharing, the ability to share physical resources, such as a 3-D printer or massive terabyte storage device,
            as well as logical resources, such as software and data, among multiple users.</td></tr>

        and STEM professionals. Our core purpose is to foster technological 
        innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>What are the benefits of IEEE membership? - With IEEE membership, you're connected to what's next in tech. 
        Gain access to groundbreaking research, trusted standards, and a global network of more than 486,000 engineers.
        Your IEEE membership adapts to your needs, offering benefits for every stage of your career. Students and young professionals can 
        access learning resources and career-boosting opportunities. Professionals at 
        all levels can tap into a global network of experts and stay 
        at the forefront of technological advancement. </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td>What are the requirements for IEEE student membership, and 
            how much does undergraduate membership cost annually for students from the USA? - 
            Membership in IEEE is open to individuals who, by education or experience, give 
            evidence of competence in an IEEE-designated field. It costs $32 for a student subscription.</td></tr>
