        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: Because a shared enterprise was impossible to pursue without the mutual understanding fostered by a common language, and (the message this story was intended to convey) the power of what people could do was thus forever limited.</span></td></tr>

        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: Early versions of Fortran required all variable identifiers to be uppercase. Also it did not allow the use of mathematical symbols such as < to compare two quantities; the keypunches that were used to create the punched cards on which early Fortran programs were submitted to the computer had no such symbols.</span></td></tr>

        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">Q: What is the difference between C and C++?</span></td></tr>
        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: C++ is in fact a “superset” of C, meaning that all of the C language is part of C++ . Everything that can be done in C, including the ability to change the contents of specific memory locations—can be done in C++ . But C++ adds many new features to C, giving it more sophistication and cleaner ways to do certain tasks. The most significant extension of C that C11 provides is the ability to do object-oriented programming.</span></td></tr>

        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: The new language was christened Ada, after Ada Augusta Byron Lovelace, daughter of the poet Lord Byron and later the wife of Lord Lovelace. Ada was trained in mathematics and science at the wish of her mother, who sought to steer Ada away from the mental instability and moral lapses. Lady Ada Lovelace is regarded as the world's first programmer on the basis of her correspondence with Charles Babbage and her published notes on his work with the Analytical Engine. </span></td></tr>

        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: Java applets are programs designed to run from webpages.

        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: Microsoft .NET is a framework that supports C# and other programming languages. The .NET framework is essentially a giant collection of tools for software development. It was designed so that traditional text-based applications, GUI applications, and web-based programs can all be built with equal ease.</span></td></tr>

        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: R is a specialized programming language designed for statistical computing and graphics. The name “R" comes at least in part from the first names of the two authors of the language, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. Like Python, R is an open source language. </span></td></tr>

        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">Q: What is Go (or Golang) and what is it used for?</span></td></tr>
        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: Go, sometimes referred to as golang, is a programming language developed at Google. One of the people involved in its development was Ken Thompson, a recipient, along with Dennis Ritchie, of the 1983 A. M. Turing Award for the development of UNIX. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, it is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. </span></td></tr>

        <tr class=><td><span class="defTitle">A: In June 2014, Apple announced a new programming language at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The language is called Swift, and it was designed for building apps on the iOS and macOS operating systems, in others words, for the iPhone/iPad and the Mac. Apple developers had long been using Objective-C, an object-oriented version of the C language. Swift borrows much from Objective-C, and can work alongside Objective-C, but with faster performance. </span></td></tr>
