        <tr class="row-item"><td><strong>Ram:</strong><br> Referred to as random access memory (RAM).
            RAM has the following three characteristics:
            Memory is divided into fixed-size units called cells, and each cell is
            associated with a unique identifier called an address. These addresses
            are the unsigned integers 0, 1, 2, ..  MAX.
            All accesses to memory are to a specified address, and we must always
            fetch or store a complete cell—that is, all the bits in that cell. The cell
            is the minimum unit of access.
            The time it takes to fetch or store the contents of a single cell is the
            same for all cells in memory.</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td><strong>Cache:</strong><br> A cache
            is typically 5-10 times faster than RAM but much smaller—on the order of a
            few megabytes rather than a few dozen gigabytes. This limited size is not a
            problem because the computer does not keep all of the data there, just those
            items that were accessed most recently and that, presumably, will be needed
            again immediately.</td> </tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td><strong>Principle of locality: The high likelihood that when a program fetches a piece of data or an instruction:</strong><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Look first in cache memory to see whether the information is there. If it is,
                then the computer can access it at the higher speed of the cache.</li>
            <li>If the desired information is not in the cache, then access it from RAM at
                the slower speed, using the fetch operation described earlier.</li>
        </ol>
        </td></tr> 
        <tr class="row-item"><td><strong>ROM:</strong><br>Read-only memory (ROM) is a special type of random access memory into
            which information has been prerecorded during manufacture. This infor-
            mation cannot be modified or removed, only fetched. ROM is used to hold important system instructions and data in a place where a user cannot acci-
            dentally or intentionally overwrite them.)</td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td> <strong>Memory cell size:</strong><br> A memory cell that contains exactly 8 binary digits.</td></tr> 
        <tr class="row-item"><td> <strong>Memory cell address:</strong> <br>          
        </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td> <strong>Maximum memory size:</strong> <br> The range of addresses available on
            a computer is [0 . . (2N - 1)], where N is the number of binary digits used to
            represent an address. This is a total of 2N memory cells. The value 2N is called
            the address space or maximum memory size of the computer.       
        </td></tr> 
        <tr class="row-item"><td> <strong>Register:</strong> <br> A register is a special high-speed storage cell that holds the operands
            of an arithmetic operation and that, when the operation is complete, holds
            its result.    
        </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td> <strong>Fetch:</strong> <br> Fetch a copy of the contents of the memory cell with the
            specified address and return those contents as the result of the operation. The original contents of the memory cell that was accessed are
            unchanged.            
        </td></tr> 
        <tr class="row-item"><td><strong> Store: </strong> <br> Store the specified value into the memory cell specified by
            address. The previous contents of the cell are lost.
        </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td><strong> Memory access time:</strong><br>One of the characteristics of random access memory is that the time to carry
            out either a fetch or a store operation is the same for all 2N addresses. At cur-
            rent levels of technology, this time, called the memory access time, is typically
            about 5-10 nanoseconds (nanosecond = 1 nsec = 10-9 seconds = 1 billionth of
            a second). </td></tr> 
        <tr class="row-item"><td><strong> DASD</strong> <br>A direct access storage device (DASD) is one in which requirement number
            2, equal access time, has been eliminated. That is, in a direct access storage
            device, every unit of information still has a unique address, but the time
            needed to access that information depends on its physical location and the
            current state of the device.
            The best examples of DASDs are the types of disks listed earlier: hard
            drives, DVDs, and so on.    
        </td></tr>
        <tr class="row-item"><td> <strong>Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) : </strong> <br>The arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) is the subsystem that 
            performs such mathematical and logical operations as addition, subtraction, and comparison for
            equality.             
        </td></tr> 
        <tr class="row-item"><td><strong> Control unit:</strong> <br>It is the task of the control unit to (1) fetch from
            memory the next instruction to be executed, (2) decode it—that is, determine
            what is to be done, and (3) execute it by issuing the appropriate command to
            the ALU, memory, or I/O controllers. These three steps are repeated over and
            over until we reach the last instruction in the program.
